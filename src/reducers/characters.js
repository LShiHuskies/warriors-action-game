When found by Grandpa Gohan, he was unruly and aggressive, wanting nothing to do with the elder, although this was seemingly only when worked up as when initially found by Gohan, he quickly took a liking to the elder. However, after the head injury that caused him to lose his programming, Goku became well-known for his energetic and caring personality.',

He is the descendant of Chilled, the second son of King Cold, the younger brother of Cooler, and the father of Kuriza. Frieza is the catalyst antagonist of the entire franchise, as it is his actions that led to Goku arriving on Earth. He has made several comebacks since his fight with Goku on Namek, including multiple invasions of Earth. Recently, he has been chosen to represent Universe 7 as the tenth member of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of Power as a replacement for Good Buu. This makes him the most recurring villain of the Dragon Ball series. After the events of the Tournament of Power, he is revived and recovers his title as Emperor of Universe 7.',

    description: ' Trunks is born in November of Age 766 to Vegeta and Bulma, thus making him a Saiyan and Human hybrid. He was an illegitimate child due to that he was conceived as a result of a brief affair between his parents. In his infancy, he was well-loved and doted on by his mother, but it appeared as if his father had little to no parental emotions towards the boy due to Vegeta never wanting to have children and viewing hybrids as a disgrace. However, after the end of the Cell Games, the relationship between his parents improved and they got married, and they began raising Trunks as a family.',

Goten is known for looking almost identical to his father as a child, to the point when Goku first meets Goten he proclaims "I think there is a little me hiding behind your leg Chi-Chi!" This resemblance to his father is pointed out numerous times by other characters throughout the series, as well as in a few video games. His appearance drastically changes as he grows older, towards the end of Dragon Ball Z. Goten\'s hair grew, so that he would not be mistaken for Goku and is seen with a shaggier hairstyle as such and also wears an orange Gi similar to what Pan wears at the World Martial Arts Tournament.',
